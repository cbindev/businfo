# Bus Feedback at RIT

This is a simple static page intended to provide RIT bus system users with information and collect their feedback.

## Future Plans
The initial scope of this website is to collect feedback using a Tally form system. In the future and as part of the club's Imagine RIT Project, the following information might or might not be provided:

- Links to current schedule timetables
- Tips for first time riders
- Real time tracking, if available
- Referrals to other apps (Transit, Passio, etc)
- Documents related to the shuttle system's operation and historical service patterns
